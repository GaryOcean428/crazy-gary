## Interaction Guidelines

### General Communication

#### Be Respectful
```markdown
✅ Good Example:
"I understand your concern about the API design. Have you considered 
the alternative approach I mentioned? I'd be happy to discuss the 
trade-offs."

❌ Bad Example:
"That's a terrible idea. Nobody would want that feature."
```

#### Be Constructive
```markdown
✅ Good Example:
"This approach might have some performance implications. Have you 
considered using a caching layer to improve response times?"

❌ Bad Example:
"This is going to be slow and break at scale."
```

#### Be Specific
```markdown
✅ Good Example:
"When I click the 'Save' button with an empty form, the error message 
appears after 5 seconds instead of immediately."

❌ Bad Example:
"The save button doesn't work."
```

### Code Review Guidelines

#### For Reviewers
```markdown
✅ Constructive Feedback:
"I like the overall structure of this component. One suggestion: 
consider adding error boundaries to handle API failures more gracefully. 
Here's an example of how we handle this in other components..."

❌ Destructive Feedback:
"This code is garbage. Why would you write it this way?"
```

#### For Contributors
```markdown
✅ Professional Response:
"Thank you for the review! I've implemented your suggestions about 
error handling. I have one question about the caching strategy - 
could you explain the rationale behind using Redis over in-memory 
caching in this case?"

❌ Defensive Response:
"I think my way is better. You just don't understand the requirements."
```

### Issue and Discussion Participation

#### Asking Questions
```markdown
✅ Well-Researched Question:
"I've been trying to implement OAuth authentication but keep getting 
CORS errors. I've checked the documentation and tried the example code, 
but I'm still having issues. Here's what I've tried so far:
[Paste code and error messages]

Has anyone else encountered this specific error with the OAuth setup?"

❌ Unresearched Question:
"How do I add authentication to my app?"
```

#### Providing Help
```markdown
✅ Helpful Response:
"I had a similar issue last week! The problem was that I wasn't 
including the 'client_id' parameter in the request. Here's the 
correct format:

[Paste example code]

Also, make sure your redirect URI is exactly what's configured 
in your OAuth provider. Let me know if you need more help!"

❌ Dismissive Response:
"Just read the documentation. It's all there."
```
