# ADR-005: Deployment and Scaling

**Date**: 2025-09-12

**Status**: Proposed

## Context

The Crazy-Gary application needs to be deployed in a way that is reliable, scalable, and easy to manage. It also needs to be able to handle a growing number of users and tasks.

## Decision

We will containerize the application using Docker and deploy it on a cloud platform that supports automatic scaling and health checks. We will use a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

For the initial deployment, we will use a single server to host all the components of the application. As the application grows, we will move to a more distributed architecture with separate servers for the frontend, backend, and MCPs.

## Consequences

*   **Pros**:
    *   Containerization will make the application portable and easy to deploy.
    *   The CI/CD pipeline will automate the deployment process and reduce the risk of human error.
    *   The cloud platform will provide a scalable and reliable infrastructure for the application.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Setting up the CI/CD pipeline and the cloud infrastructure will require an initial investment of time and effort.
