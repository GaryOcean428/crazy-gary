# Advanced Dashboard Feature

## Overview

The Advanced Dashboard feature provides comprehensive data visualization, real-time monitoring, and customizable analytics capabilities. This feature follows modern React/TypeScript architecture patterns with proper domain separation and business logic isolation.

## Architecture

This feature is organized using feature-based architecture following 2025 best practices:

```
src/features/dashboard/
├── components/
│   ├── DynamicDashboardControls.tsx    # Main dashboard component
│   └── index.ts                        # Barrel exports
├── hooks/
│   └── index.ts                        # Custom hooks for business logic
├── types/
│   └── index.ts                        # TypeScript domain models
├── services/                           # Future: API integration
├── hooks.ts                            # Hook exports
├── types.ts                            # Type exports
└── index.ts                            # Feature exports
```

## Component Architecture

### Main Component: `DynamicDashboardControls`

Advanced dashboard component that provides:

- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Live metrics with configurable refresh intervals
- **Interactive Filtering**: Complex conditional logic with async processing
- **Customizable Layouts**: Grid, flex, and masonry layout options
- **Template Management**: Save/load dashboard configurations
- **Theme Integration**: Light, dark, and auto theme support

### Custom Hooks

**Business Logic Separation**: The component uses custom hooks to separate concerns:

- `useRealtimeMetrics`: Manages real-time data updates and metric generation
- `useDashboardTemplates`: Handles template saving, loading, and persistence
- `useDashboardFilters`: Manages filter application and async processing

### Type Safety

**Domain Modeling**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces:

- `DashboardConfig`: Main dashboard configuration structure
- `FilterConfig`: Filter definition and state management
- `VisualizationConfig`: Chart and visualization settings
- `MetricData`: Real-time metric data structure

## Features

### Real-time Metrics Dashboard
- Live updating metrics with trend indicators
- Color-coded status displays
- Animated transitions and micro-interactions
- Performance-optimized rendering

### Advanced Filtering System
- Multiple filter types (text, select, range, date, boolean)
- Complex conditional logic (equals, contains, greater, less, between)
- Async filter application with loading states
- Filter persistence and template integration

### Customization & Personalization
- Theme selection (light, dark, auto)
- Layout preferences (grid, flex, masonry)
- Configurable refresh intervals (1-30 seconds)
- Animation and notification preferences

### Template Management
- Save current dashboard configurations
- Load saved templates with smooth transitions
- Template sharing and export capabilities
- Visual template previews with metadata

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import { DynamicDashboardControls } from '@/features/dashboard'

export function AdvancedDashboardPage() {
  return <DynamicDashboardControls />
}
```

### Routing Integration

The dashboard is accessible via the `/dashboard/advanced` route and integrated into the main navigation.

### Customization

The component handles its own state management and provides:
- Automatic theme integration
- Real-time data updates
- Template persistence
- Responsive design

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoized Calculations**: Uses `useMemo` for expensive computations
- **Optimized Renders**: Strategic `useCallback` usage prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking filter application and data updates
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of intervals and event listeners

### Animation System
- **Framer Motion**: 60fps animations with GPU acceleration
- **Staggered Animations**: Visual hierarchy through delayed animations
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects and loading states
- **Accessibility**: Respects reduced motion preferences

### State Management
- **Feature-based Organization**: Hooks contain domain-specific logic
- **TypeScript Safety**: Strict typing with comprehensive interfaces
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI components separate from business logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

## Integration

### Navigation
- Added to sidebar navigation as "Advanced Dashboard"
- Accessible via `/dashboard/advanced` route
- Proper icon integration with BarChart3 from Lucide React

### Theme System
- Automatically integrates with application theme provider
- Respects user theme preferences (light/dark/auto)
- Consistent color scheme with application design system

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode compliance
- Domain-specific type definitions
- Proper import/export structure with barrel exports

## Future Enhancements

### Data Integration
- Connect to real data sources via services layer
- API integration for persistent template storage
- Real-time WebSocket data updates

### Advanced Features
- Drag-and-drop dashboard builder
- More visualization types (charts, graphs, tables)
- Collaborative dashboard sharing
- Export capabilities (PDF, Excel, PNG)

### Analytics
- User interaction tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Usage pattern analysis
- A/B testing framework

## Testing

The feature maintains test compatibility:
- Component renders without errors
- Hooks function correctly in isolation
- TypeScript compilation without issues
- Integration with existing test suite

## Migration Notes

This feature was restructured from development-phase naming to proper business domain organization:
- Moved from `/components/phase2/` to `/features/dashboard/`
- Updated routing from `/phase2` to `/dashboard/advanced`
- Refactored business logic into custom hooks
- Improved type safety and domain modeling
- Enhanced documentation and maintainability
