# 502 Error Fix - Railway Deployment

## Problem
The application was returning 502 errors on Railway because it failed to start due to missing required environment variables, specifically `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`.

## Root Cause
- The `HarmonyClient` class constructor threw an exception when `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` was not set
- This happened during module import time, preventing the entire Flask application from starting
- Railway returned 502 errors because the application process crashed immediately

## Solution
Implemented graceful degradation for optional AI services:

### 1. HarmonyClient Changes
- Modified constructor to allow initialization without API key
- Added `is_available()` method to check service availability
- Implemented fallback responses when AI services are unavailable
- Updated all methods to handle missing dependencies gracefully

### 2. HeavyOrchestrator Changes  
- Added null checks before using HarmonyClient
- Implemented simple fallback responses when AI is unavailable
- Fixed error handling and syntax issues

## Results
✅ **Application now starts successfully without `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`**
✅ **All basic routes work (/, /health, /favicon.ico)**
✅ **Health checks return proper status codes**
✅ **No more 502 errors**

## Deployment Status

The application is now successfully deployed to Railway at:
- **Main URL**: https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/
- **Health Check**: https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/health
- **Readiness Check**: https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/health/ready
- **Liveness Check**: https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/health/live

**Live Test Results:**
```bash
curl https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/health
# {"service":"crazy-gary-api","status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0"}

curl https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/health/ready  
# {"status":"ready"}

curl https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/health/live
# {"status":"alive"}
```

## Port Configuration Fix
Fixed Railway deployment port mismatch:
- Railway was auto-assigning PORT=5432 but domain was configured for port 8080
- Added explicit `PORT=8080` environment variable in Railway
- Domain routing now correctly matches application port

The application can now be deployed to Railway and will:
- Start successfully even without AI API keys
- Serve static content and basic functionality
- Return appropriate health check responses
- Display warnings about missing optional services in logs


## Optional Configuration
To enable full AI functionality, set these environment variables in Railway:
```
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_key_here
HF_BASE_URL_120B=your_120b_endpoint
HF_BASE_URL_20B=your_20b_endpoint
```

## Health Check Endpoints
- `/health` - Always returns 200 if app is running
- `/health/ready` - Returns 503 if required env vars missing, 200 if ready
- `/health/live` - Simple liveness check

The fix ensures the application prioritizes availability over full functionality, allowing basic operation while clearly indicating when optional services are unavailable.
