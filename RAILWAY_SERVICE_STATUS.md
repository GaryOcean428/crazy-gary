**Service**: crazy-gary (ID: 012a5027-3fd9-4f51-bc70-39f9e1470345)
**Environment**: production (ID: 44ed8e03-5a40-45b4-9f7f-63e2f5c979f2)

## Deployment URLs (Verified)
- **Primary Domain**: `crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app`

## Service Health Status ✅
```bash
# All endpoints returning 200 OK
curl https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/health
curl https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/health/ready
curl https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/health/live
curl https://crazy-gary-production.up.railway.app/
```

## Environment Variables Status
✅ **HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY**: Configured and working
✅ **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connected
✅ **REDIS_URL**: Redis connected  
✅ **PORT**: Explicitly set to 8080 (fixed deployment issue)
✅ **JWT_SECRET_KEY**: Configured
✅ **SECRET_KEY**: Configured

## Recent Fix Applied
1. **Port Mismatch Resolution**: Railway was auto-assigning PORT=5432, but domain routing expected 8080
2. **Environment Variable**: Added explicit `PORT=8080` to Railway service configuration  
3. **Deployment**: Triggered service restart to apply port configuration
4. **Verification**: All health endpoints now responding correctly

## Conclusion
Service is fully operational on Railway with correct URL routing. No localhost references in deployment - all testing performed against live Railway URLs.
