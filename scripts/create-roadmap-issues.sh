    # Issue 1: A2A AgentCard Protocol
    issue1_desc="## Feature Description

### Summary
Implement the complete A2A AgentCard protocol specification including tasks/send and tasks/sendSubscribe flows for agent-to-agent communication.

### Problem Statement
Current system lacks standardized agent communication protocol, limiting multi-agent orchestration capabilities.

### Proposed Solution
- Implement A2A AgentCard specification
- Add tasks/send endpoint for agent communication
- Add tasks/sendSubscribe flow for real-time updates
- Create AgentCard validation and routing

### Roadmap Quarter
- [x] Q1 - Foundations & Reliability

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A2A AgentCard protocol fully implemented
- [ ] tasks/send endpoint functional and tested
- [ ] tasks/sendSubscribe flow working
- [ ] Protocol documentation updated
- [ ] Integration tests passing

### Technical Requirements
- Update MCP orchestrator to support A2A protocol
- Add AgentCard validation middleware
- Implement routing for agent communication
- Add protocol version management

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for AgentCard validation
- [ ] Integration tests for communication flows
- [ ] E2E tests for multi-agent scenarios
- [ ] Protocol compliance tests

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] A2A protocol specification
- [ ] API endpoint documentation
- [ ] Integration examples
- [ ] Developer guide updates"

    # Issue 2: MCP Server Integration
    issue2_desc="## Feature Description

### Summary
Add baseline MCP server integration starting with filesystem and git MCP servers, including auto-discovery mechanisms.

### Problem Statement
Current MCP integration is limited and lacks standardized server discovery, reducing tool availability and integration capabilities.

### Proposed Solution
- Integrate filesystem MCP server for file operations
- Integrate git MCP server for version control operations
- Create MCP server auto-discovery mechanism
- Add server health monitoring

### Roadmap Quarter
- [x] Q1 - Foundations & Reliability

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Filesystem MCP server integrated and functional
- [ ] Git MCP server integrated and functional
- [ ] Auto-discovery of MCP servers working
- [ ] Server health monitoring implemented
- [ ] MCP integration tests passing

### Technical Requirements
- Extend MCPOrchestrator for new server types
- Add server discovery service
- Implement health check endpoints for MCP servers
- Add error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for MCP server integration
- [ ] Integration tests for file and git operations
- [ ] Health check monitoring tests
- [ ] Error handling tests

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] MCP server setup guide
- [ ] Integration documentation
- [ ] Tool usage examples"
